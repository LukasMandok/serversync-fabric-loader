# What is it?
A very basic Forge mod that starts a [ServerSync](https://github.com/superzanti/ServerSync) server after the Minecraft server loads.

# Why?
Some users do not have access to their server host in order to run their own startup scripts, this mod allows those users to still use ServerSync.
